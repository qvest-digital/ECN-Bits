┃ ECN-Bits • C/CLI for Winsock2 ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

┌─────────────┐
│ Compilation │
└─────────────┘

On unixoid systems, this can be compiled the same way as the C/CLI
for Darwin/Linux/FreeBSD/MidnightBSD, in ../c/ (see there), and in
fact, that version makes for a better example on those platforms,
unless Winsock2 support is a requirement.

WSL 1 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) counts as Linux for sake of porting.
WSL 2 is actually a Linux virtual machine and, if one can get networking
to run inside it good enough for the task, thus can be treated as plain
unmodified Linux.

On Windows, run VsDevCmd.bat or similar¹ to ensure all environment
variables are set up correctly for building, then issue the command…

	nmake
… or…
	nmake DEBUG=1

… in the top-level “ws2\” directory to compile a DLL and link against
it; to build a static library, add NOPIC=1 as well. To clean up again, run…

	nmake clean

… also when switching between static and DLL builds! (Even the object
files of the example applications must be rebuilt when doing so.)

Link a program either with -lecn-bitw (Unix), against ecn-bitw_imp.lib
(Win32, using the DLL) or ecn-bitw.lib (Win32, with the static library)
to use the library; headers and functions are documented in the manual
pages (which are also provided as preformatted plaintext, for Windows).

┌───────────────────────┐
│ Example client/server │
└───────────────────────┘

These applications demonstrate how to use the ECN-Bits library
and are deliberately simple. See SCReAM for an actual example
of how to develop L4Sified bandwidth-adaptive applications.

Run the server on one system: server.exe [host] port
(The arguments are for what IP/port this should bind to.
Numeric and NSS values are supported.)

Run the client on another (or same) system: client.exe host post
(The arguments are for what system to connect to.)

Unlike the standard Unix variant, this client and server do not
have an extra argument for setting the outgoing traffic class octets
as Windows lacks support for doing so.

The client will send a “hello” packet to the server, which
receives it, displays a line with the timestamp it received
the packet, whether it was truncated, which ECN bits were set,
and its content.

The server then sends a packets back, with almost the same
content (truncation, server timestamp, received ECN bits).

The client (after sending the initial packet it waits for up
to a second for responses) displays the packet data received
together with their ECN bits and local timestamps. (Timestamps
are in UTC.)

Both applications support IPv6 and legacy IPv4; the client
can be used against e.g. the BSD inetd daytime service as well,
or netcat-openbsd, for testing. The client terminates after
one run; the server can be terminated by pressing Ctrl-C.

Example session:

SERVER│C>bin\server 1234
SERVER│Listening on [::]:1234... ok
SERVER│Listening on [0.0.0.0]:1234... ok
SERVER│
CLIENT│C>bin\client localhost 1234
CLIENT│Trying [::1]:1234... connected
SERVER│2020-09-20T17:10:32Z notrunc [::1]:51119 no ECN{00} <hi!>
CLIENT│2020-09-20T17:10:32Z no ECN{00} <[::1]:51119 2020-09-20T17:10:32Z no ECN{00} notrunc -> default>
CLIENT│Trying [127.0.0.1]:1234... connected
SERVER│2020-09-20T17:10:33Z notrunc [127.0.0.1]:51120 no ECN{00} <hi!>
CLIENT│2020-09-20T17:10:33Z no ECN{00} <[127.0.0.1]:51120 2020-09-20T17:10:33Z no ECN{00} notrunc -> default>

See ../c/README for an example session on Unix and extra caveats.

┌─────────────┐
│ Portability │
└─────────────┘

See ../c/README for portability considerations on Unix.

Using v4-mapped IPv6 addresses works on WSL 1 but not on native Windows.

The traffic class for outgoing packets cannot be set under
Windows®, native or WSL 1, at all. This is a system limitation.
For this reason this version (ws2/ aka libecn-bitw) does not
ship certain functions dealing with outgoing traffic class
setting; if needed, the c/ (libecn-bits) version contains them.

WSL 2, being a Linux virtual machine, suffers from neither restriction.

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Extra functions for high-level language integration │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

The library includes a few functions for better HLL support as well.
They are not intended to be called by end users, therefore they are
not documented with the other functions in the manual pages; comments
in the source code (lib/hll*.c) should sufficiently do that and they
are used by the .NET and Unity integration currently, so that serves
as another example. These are of interest mainly to integrators who
work on the ECN-Bits project itself.
