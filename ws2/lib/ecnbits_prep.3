.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ecnbits_prep
function sets up a network socket (IPv6 or legacy IPv4) to retrieve
ECN bits, or rather, the traffic class octet, from incoming packets.
This works well with datagram sockets (UDP); use with stream sockets
(TCP) may not work completely, for example the operating system may
change the sent traffic class value.
Operating on v4-mapped IPv6 sockets
.Pq Li ::FFFF.0.0.0.0/96
may be unsupported
.Pq but known to work on Linux/Android/WSL\ 2 , WSL\ 1 , Darwin/macOS .
This function is thread-safe.
.Pp
The
.Ar handle
itself is not changed, but a few socket options are enabled.
For this to work, the
.Ar af
argument is expected to carry the address family used with the socket
.Pq Li AF_INET6 No or Li AF_INET ;
this is the same as the first argument to
.Xr socket 2
.Pq Li domain .
Only these address families are known.
.Pp
The convenience function
.Fn ecnbits_tc
function sets the default traffic class outgoing packets are sent with.
This function is thread-safe.
.Pp
The
.Ar iptos
value is expected to contain the traffic class octet intended to be
sent out with this socket; this can be one of the ECN values...
.Bd -literal
#define ECNBITS_NON	0 /* non-ECN-capable transport */
#define ECNBITS_ECT0	2 /* ECN-capable; L4S: legacy transport */
#define ECNBITS_ECT1	1 /* ECN-capable; L4S: L4S-aware transport */
#define ECNBITS_CE	3 /* congestion experienced */
.Ed
.Pp
\&... possibly or'd with a system-provided value such as
.Dv IPTOS_LOWDELAY ,
a DSCP and/or class value or really anything appropriate.
The operating system defaults usually to either
.Li 0 Pq Li ECNBITS_NON
or
.Li 2 Pq Li ECNBITS_ECT0 .
Note that ISPs can change the traffic class of packets they transmit.
.Pp
The
.Ar iptos
value is only used to set the default outgoing traffic class.
It can still be overridden by using
.Xr sendmsg 2
with a suitable
.Xr cmsg 3
control message such as one created by
.Xr ecnbits_mkcmsg 3 ;
this technique is demonstrated by the ECN-Bits server example.
In fact, as shown in the client example, calling
.Fn ecnbits_tc
is not needed if the technique is used.
See
.Sx CAVEATS
below regarding Darwin/Mac\ OSX or Winsock2.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn ecnbits_prep
function sets the global variable
.Va errno
to indicate any problem and returns the value 2 on error, 1 if v4-mapped
support could not be set up (compare against
.Dv ECNBITS_PREP_FATAL
.Pq see Sx EXAMPLES No below
to determine if this should be ignored), and 0 on success.
.Pp
The
.Fn ecnbits_tc
function sets the global variable
.Va errno
to indicate any problem and returns the value 2 on error, 1 if v4-mapped
support could not be set up (compare against
.Dv ECNBITS_TC_FATAL
.Pq see Sx EXAMPLES No below
to determine if this should be ignored), and 0 on success.
.Pp
On Winsock2,
.Fn WSAGetLastError
must be used to retrieve the error code.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment illustrates the usage:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
SOCKET handle;

if ((handle = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)) == INVALID_SOCKET)
	err(1, "socket");
/* do other setsockopt, if needed */
if (ECNBITS_PREP_FATAL(ecnbits_prep(handle, AF_INET6)))
	err(1, "ecnbits_setup: incoming traffic class");
#ifdef DONTUSE_MKCMSG
if (ECNBITS_TC_FATAL(ecnbits_tc(handle, AF_INET6, ECNBITS_ECT0)))
	err(1, "ecnbits_setup: outgoing traffic class");
#endif
/* connect, bind, etc. */
.Ed
.Pp
Note
.Fn ECNBITS_TC_FATAL
silently ignores WSL\ 1 failures, but
.Fn ecnbits_tc
always fails on Winsock2 (i.e.\& native Windows\(rg).
.Sh ERRORS
Besides the errors returned by the system calls used internally (currently, only
.Xr setsockopt 2 ,
but this is implementation detail subject to change without notice),
.Er WSAEAFNOSUPPORT
is returned if
.Ar af
is unknown.

.Sh STANDARDS
The implementation uses socket calls documented in the MidnightBSD manual page
.Xr ip6 4
.Pq standardised by RFC\ 3542
for IPv6, those documented by the MidnightBSD
.Xr ip 4
or GNU/Linux
.Xr ip 7
manual pages for legacy IPv4.
.Pp
The socket options for receiving the IP traffic class are also supported
on Windows\(rg environments, although setting the outgoing default isn't.

.Sh CAVEATS
Using v4-mapped IPv6 sockets should be avoided; it only works on Linux
(including WSL\ 1
.Pq but not native Windows ,
WSL\ 2, Android), if even that.
It also works on Darwin (Mac OSX), except
.Fn ecnbits_tc
cannot set the DSCP bits, only the ECN bits, on v4-mapped sockets.
.Pp
Consider not using
.Fn ecnbits_tc
but setting the outgoing ECN bits on each individual packet using
.Fn ecnbits_mkcmsg
and
.Xr sendmsg 2
.Pq even if they are the same
due to Winsock2 only supporting the latter.
.Pp
.Er EAFNOSUPPORT
is used in its original
.Tn POSIX
meaning:
The implementation does not support the specified address family.
