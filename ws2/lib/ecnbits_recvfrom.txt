ECNBITS_RECVFROM(3)      BSD Library Functions Manual      ECNBITS_RECVFROM(3)

NAME
     ecnbits_read, ecnbits_recv, ecnbits_recvfrom -- receive a message (read a
     packet) from a socket and determine the traffic class including ECN bits

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #if defined(_WIN32) || defined(WIN32)
     #include <winsock2.h>
     #include <ws2tcpip.h>
     #else
     #include <sys/socket.h>
     #endif
     #include <ecn-bitw.h>

     SSIZE_T
     ecnbits_read(SOCKET fd, void *buf, size_t buflen,
         unsigned short *ecnresult);

     SSIZE_T
     ecnbits_recv(SOCKET fd, void *buf, size_t buflen, int flags,
         unsigned short *ecnresult);

     SSIZE_T
     ecnbits_recvfrom(SOCKET fd, void *buf, size_t buflen, int flags,
         struct sockaddr *src_addr, socklen_t *addrlen,
         unsigned short *ecnresult);

     Outside of Winsock2, the SOCKET type is int; SSIZE_T is spelt ssize_t.

DESCRIPTION
     The ecnbits_read() macro is equivalent to calling the ecnbits_recv()
     function with a flags argument of 0.  See CAVEATS below.

     The ecnbits_recv() and ecnbits_recvfrom() functions work equivalent to
     the system functions recv(2) and recvfrom(2) respectively, but take an
     extra argument ecnresult.  If ecnresult is NULL, these functions just
     pass control to the equivalent system function.  Otherwise, an equivalent
     recvmsg(2) system call (on Winsock2: ecnws2_recvmsg() library call) is
     executed in order to be able to determine the traffic class octet of the
     received packet.

     If ecnresult is not NULL and the call was successful (did not return
     (SSIZE_T)-1), the location pointed to by ecnresult will, upon return,
     contain the traffic class of the received packet, in ECNBITS_VALID(3)
     format, if determining it was possible (otherwise, it will read as not
     valid).  If the socket was not set up with ecnbits_prep(3) beforehand,
     determining the traffic class octet is usually not possible.

     As with the equivalent system function, ecnbits_recvfrom() stores the ad-
     dress of the packet sender in the user-allocated src_addr argument; for
     connected sockets or if the user is not interested in it, NULL should be
     passed for src_addr.  See recvfrom(2) for the description of flags.

RETURN VALUES
     The ecnbits_read(), ecnbits_recv() and ecnbits_recvfrom() functions re-
     turn the number of bytes received if successful; otherwise the value -1
     is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

     On Winsock2, WSAGetLastError() must be used to retrieve the error code.

EXAMPLES
     The following code fragment illustrates the usage:

           char buf[512];
           unsigned short ecnresult;

           if (ecnbits_read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf), &ecnresult) == (SSIZE_T)-1)
                   err(1, "read");
           if (ECNBITS_VALID(ecnresult))
                   printf("%s\n", ecnbits_meanings[ECNBITS_BITS(ecnresult)]);

     Note that the socket, after creation, must have been set up with a call
     to ecnbits_prep(3) (once) prior to use with these functions.

ERRORS
     These functions return the same errors as the underlying system calls:
     recv(2) or recvfrom(2) if ecnresult is NULL, recvmsg(2) otherwise.

CAVEATS
     ecnbits_read, ecnbits_recv and ecnbits_recvfrom are now thread-safe.
     Should determining the traffic class fail due to control message buffer
     truncation, recompile the library with a larger ECNBITS_CMSGBUFLEN.

     The semantics of read(2) and recv(2) upon reading a zero-length datagram
     differ: the latter consumes the pending datagram, while the former has no
     effect.  ecnbits_read() uses recv(2) semantics, not those of read(2).

     Please also read the STANDARDS section of ecnbits_prep(3).
