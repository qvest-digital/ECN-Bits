ECNWS2_RECVMSG(3)        BSD Library Functions Manual        ECNWS2_RECVMSG(3)

NAME
     ecnws2_recvmsg, ecnws2_sendmsg -- Winsock2 sendmsg and recvmsg wrappers
     with POSIX error signalling semantics, BSD sockets drop-in compatible

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <winsock2.h>
     #include <ws2tcpip.h>
     #include <ecn-bitw.h>

     SSIZE_T
     ecnws2_recvmsg(SOCKET handle, LPWSAMSG msg, int flags);

     SSIZE_T
     ecnws2_sendmsg(SOCKET handle, LPWSAMSG msg, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The ecnws2_recvmsg() and ecnws2_sendmsg() functions work equivalent to
     the Unix system calls recvmsg(2) and sendmsg(2), respectively, and wrap
     the Winsock2 functions WSARecvMsg() (retrieved from WSAIoctl() via
     function pointer) and WSASendMsg() (directly available as of NT 6.00).

     While the calling conventions match that of the BSD socket functions, the
     actual arguments are the corresponding Winsock2 types (which fully map
     the same functionality merely using different structure member names).
     Overlapping sockets (a Winsock2 extension) are not supported.

     ecnws2_recvmsg() receives a message from a socket; the only valid flags,
     which will overwrite msg->dwFlags, is MSG_PEEK (or 0 of course).

     ecnws2_sendmsg() sends a message over a socket.  The flags argument can
     be any of MSG_DONTROUTE and MSG_PARTIAL, or'd together, or 0 of course;
     the msg->dwFlags (msg->msg_flags equivalent) member is not used.

     These functions are only present in the library if compiling for Windows.
     While they are shipped as part of the ECN-Bits library, they have in no
     way anything to do with access to the IP traffic class octet.  They are
     provided as compatibility wrappers, to allow for easier porting BSD
     socket programs to Winsock2; ecnws2_recvmsg() is also used internally.

RETURN VALUES
     The ecnws2_recvmsg() function returns the number of bytes received if
     successful; otherwise, the value -1 is returned, and subsequently calling
     WSAGetLastError() will retrieve the error code.

     The ecnws2_sendmsg() function returns the number of bytes sent if suc-
     cessful; otherwise, the value -1 is returned, and subsequently calling
     WSAGetLastError() will retrieve the error code.

EXAMPLES
     The following code fragment illustrates the usage:

           char buf[32];
           WSAMSG msg;
           WSABUF iov;

           memset(&msg, 0, sizeof(msg));
           iov.buf = buf;
           iov.len = sizeof(buf);
           msg.lpBuffers = &iov;
           msg.dwBufferCount = 1;
           if (ecnws2_recvmsg(hSocket, &msg, MSG_PEEK) == (SSIZE_T)-1)
                   fprintf(stderr, "in recvmsg: error %08X", WSAGetLastError());
           /* inspect buf[] as beginning of next packet */

ERRORS
     These functions return the same errors as the underlying Winsock2 APIs.

CAVEATS
     The WSARecvMsg() function pointer is cached; therefore, ecnws2_recvmsg()
     may not be used with sockets created using a different (non-default)
     Winsock service provider.

     If the WSAIoctl(SIO_GET_EXTENSION_FUNCTION_POINTER, WSAID_WSARECVMSG)
     call to obtain WSARecvMsg fails, ecnws2_recvmsg() will return -1, but the
     last error code will be that of WSAIoctl.  A subsequent ecnws2_recvmsg()
     call will retry the ioctl, always using the provided socket handle.
