# This file is read before [mM]akefile by BSD make.
# Normally we’d create a BSDmakefile calling gmake,
# forwarding all targets, but NetBSD® broke the API
# stopping searching BSDmakefile before [mM]akefile
# and the latter (case-insensitively) is what nmake
# on Windows® already uses. GNU make still searches
# for GNUmakefile first which we make (hah!) use of
# here already. Unfortunately, this means erroring,
# printing a suitable warning to use gmake instead,
# is all we can do, on “modern” BSD make (and bmake
# packaged for GNU systems) anyway (traditional BSD
# systems could use BSDmakefile, but then we’d lose
# the ability to warn bmake users which then wonder
# as 「/bin/sh: cannot create lib: Is a directory」
# isn’t a helpful error message.

.error Use gmake (not make) on BSD; read .depend for why.
