Thus, for the Android and OpenJDK/Linux library, the following holds:

| All three licences must be adhered to: the Apache 2 licence for the
| “nh” module *only*; both MirBSD and GPLv2 with Classpath Exception
| for the OpenJDK‑/Android-libcore-derived code in this project, and
| just The MirOS Licence for the rest of this project.

The OpenJDK/Linux library additionally contains, as a resource, the
Inconsolatazi4varlquAH.ttf font used for the DatagramChannel Swing
example application. This font file is Copyright ©
	2021 mirabilos <t.glaser@tarent.de>
	2017 mirabilos <m@mirbsd.org>
	2013–2016 Michael Sharpe <msharpe@ucsd.edu>
	2006–2012 Raph Levien <raph.levien@gmail.com>
and covered by both the SIL Open Font License 1.1, reproduced in the
file jdk-linux/src/legal/OFLv1.1, and The MirOS Licence (see above);
both licences must be honoured. (An eventual Inconsolatus QL [MirOS]
release is expected to supercede this.)

The Android skeleton was autogenerated by IntelliJ IDEA 2020.1 (most
of which trivial enough to lack copyright). OutputListAdapter is the
“obvious” minimal implementation for a RecyclerView adapter and thus
also in the Public Domain. The Gradle wrapper included in the skele‐
ton is licenced separately, see below. At build time extra libraries
will be downloaded and used, some included in the APK; refer to each
individually for copyright notes and licence terms. Everything else,
also as a collective-work licence, is published under the MirBSD li‐
cence reproduced at the top of this file.

Gradle wrapper 6.8.3 © 2007–2014, 2015, 2017 and published under the
terms of the Apache 2 licence; see android/gradle* for full notices,
source code and specifics; as to the full text of the licence, refer
to: android/ecn-lib/src/main/resources/LICENSE-2.0
