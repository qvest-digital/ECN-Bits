┃ ECN-Bits • Java™ library for OpenJDK on Linux ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

See ../README for what this is all about,
and ../android/README for the implementation this one is derived from.

Welcome to the OpenJDK/Linux implementation! This library is
specific to the Linux kernel, including WSL 2, because it’s
been written for Android originally, but should also work on
WSL 1, with the usual caveat of setting outgoing bits there.

This library has been tested with OpenJDK 11 but should run on
JRE 8 and above but below 15, which changes the DatagramSocket
implementation in an incompatible way.

This library mostly offers the following entry points:
• de.telekom.llcto.ecn_bits.android.lib.Bits
• de.telekom.llcto.ecn_bits.android.lib.ECNBitsDatagramChannel
  (extends DatagramChannel) via static open() factory method
• de.telekom.llcto.ecn_bits.android.lib.ECNBitsDatagramSocket
  (extends DatagramSocket) via new and constructors

Both ECNBitsDatagramSocket and the ECNBitsDatagramChannel.socket()
result derive from AbstractECNBitsDatagramSocket (which itself
derives from DatagramSocket). Both AbstractECNBitsDatagramSocket
and ECNBitsDatagramChannel implement AbstractECNBitsDatagramReceiver
with the methods to inspect the IP traffic class octet of the last
packet received or to measure congestion in the background:

The user can either retrieve, for each received datagram,
the IP traffic class byte (using the retrieveLastTrafficClass
method on the socket), or by using the startMeasurement method
and then calling the getMeasurement method periodically, e.g.
every 20 ms, retrieving the congestion factor from its result.

For either AbstractECNBitsDatagramSocket implementation, when
reusing DatagramPacket instances, (re‑)setting their length
before each receive call is mandatory.

This library contains Main classes to demonstrate how it can
be used; these don’t disturb normal operation. The library can
just be added as Maven dependency and be used within arbitrary
libraries or programs but, because the JNI dependency must be
compiled targetting the correct CPU architecture, it must be
(re‑)compiled suiting the system eventually running it.

Normal Maven invocations are used to compile this, that is:

	$ mvn clean package #[install]

Maven shells out compilation of the JNI library; for this,
mksh and cmake as well as a C and C++ compiler and headers
for the JDK and the system libc must be made available (and
it builds on Linux only obviously).

It’d probably be best if API for retrieving the traffic class
could be added to OpenJDK directly.

Note that IPv6 addresses look ugly in Java because it violates
RFC 5952 § 4.2, and besides that RFC 5952 § 4.3 also is ugly.
They will be legible enough, though (for our purposes anyway).

┌──────────┐
│ Examples │
└──────────┘

These examples require having built the library first, as they
depend on tools used to compile, and the JNI search path is set
to where the compiled DLL is placed by CMake.

‣ CHANNEL

Run the DatagramChannel client: ./channel.sh [--opts] host port

This will start an interactive GUI in which the user can send
packets (by pressing Enter, Alt-S or clicking the S̲end button),
switch between the host’s IP addresses, and change what traffic
class is set on outgoing packets. The M̲easure button shows how
many received packets were in congestion since its last usage
respectively since the destination IP last switched.

Should GUI issues occur use --metal to avoid the Motif theme or
--theme=<theme> to set one (use --theme to list the installed
themes) or --theme=system to not set the look and feel.

‣ SOCKET

Run the DatagramSocket client: ./client.sh host post [tc]

Arguments are:
• host: IP address or hostname (DNS-resolved) of server to send to
  (multiple results are attempted in order)
• port: (server) port to send to
• tc: traffic class for sent packets, default: ECT0
  valid: NO, ECT0, ECT1, CE or a decimal, octal (leading 0) or
  hexadecimal (leading 0x) integer between 0 and 255, inclusive

The client will send a “hello” packet to the server. After that
it waits for up to a second for responses, which it displays as
the packet data received together with their ECN bits and local
timestamps. (Timestamps are in UTC.) This was modelled after the
C/CLI example (see ../c/README) and can run against its server,
or any UDP echo server (e.g. inetd daytime), although *those*
won’t set varying ECN bits on the response package.

When downloading the JAR extract the scripts (client.sh, etc.)
using jar or unzip and put them together into the same directory
and ensure your local Maven repository cache has all dependencies.
